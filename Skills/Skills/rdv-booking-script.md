## 🎯 Objective

Write a LinkedIn message that moves a conversation toward a qualified meeting.

The goal is to:
- assess if the lead is relevant
- avoid wasting time with low-quality prospects
- propose a call naturally when appropriate

The message must feel conversational, not like a sales script.

---

## 📥 Required Inputs

Ask the user for:

1. Conversation context (what has been said so far)
2. Who the lead is (role, industry, situation)
3. Your offer (short description)
4. Goal:
   - qualify
   - propose a call
   - filter out
5. Optional: level of intent (cold / warm / hot)

If missing, ask concise follow-up questions.

---

## 🧠 Execution Rules

- Keep it short (3–5 lines max)
- No aggressive CTA
- No “book a call now”
- No pressure
- No long explanations
- No corporate tone
- Always sound human and adaptive
- Focus on clarity and relevance

---

## ⚙️ Conversation Logic

The message should follow:

1. Acknowledge the situation or previous exchange
2. Introduce a relevant angle or observation
3. Qualify the lead (1 key question)
4. If relevant → suggest a call naturally

---

## 🎯 Intent Handling

### If goal = qualify
→ Ask a precise question to understand their situation

### If goal = propose a call
→ Only if signals are positive  
→ Suggest simply, without forcing

Example:
“Happy to exchange briefly if useful — could make sense depending on your situation.”

### If goal = filter out
→ Stay polite  
→ Reduce energy investment  
→ Avoid pushing further

---

## 🧾 Output Format

Provide:

### 🔹 Message
[Text]

### 🔹 Intent
(Explain in 1 sentence what this message is trying to achieve)

---

## 🧪 Example (Good Case)

**Input:**
Context: Prospect said they struggle to generate leads  
Lead: B2B consultant  
Offer: LinkedIn lead generation system  
Goal: propose a call  

**Output:**

### 🔹 Message
Makes sense — that’s something I see quite often.

Out of curiosity, are you actively trying to fix it right now or just exploring options?

If it’s something you’re working on, happy to exchange briefly — might give you a few useful angles.

### 🔹 Intent
Qualify urgency and suggest a call only if the lead shows real interest.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to do

- No “Let’s book a call”
- No calendar link directly
- No long pitch
- No closing techniques
- No pressure language
- No fake urgency

---

## 🧠 Quality Check (Mandatory)

Before finalizing, verify:

- Does it feel natural and fluid?
- Does it filter or qualify?
- Is the call suggestion subtle and contextual?
- Would you personally send this?

If not, rewrite.
